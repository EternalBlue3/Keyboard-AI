A fully differential calculation in perturbative quantum chromodynamics is presented for the production of massive photon pairs at hadron colliders. All next-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark, gluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well as all-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space is specified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is demonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for more detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for distributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs boson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing that enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious selection of events.

Several factors contributed to the UK's decision to leave the EU. A significant aspect was the issue of sovereignty. Proponents of Brexit argued that EU membership undermined the UK's ability to govern itself and make independent decisions on matters such as trade, immigration, and regulations. Concerns over the loss of control over borders and increasing influence of Brussels resonated with many who felt their national identity was being eroded. Additionally, economic disparities, particularly between London and other regions, fueled a sense of frustration and dissatisfaction with EU policies, including the freedom of movement.

Following the referendum result, formal negotiations between the UK and the EU began in March 2017. The negotiations were complex, covering a wide range of issues, such as trade, citizens' rights, and the Irish border. The process was marked by heated debates, disagreements, and multiple extensions. Eventually, on January 31, 2020, the UK officially left the EU, entering into a transition period during which both parties worked to establish their future relationship. On December 31, 2020, the transition period ended, and the UK fully withdrew from the EU's single market and customs union, initiating a new era in the relationship between the UK and the EU.

Brexit has had profound implications for the UK. Economically, the country faces both challenges and opportunities. While Brexit supporters argued for greater economic independence and the ability to strike trade deals with non-EU nations, critics voiced concerns over the potential negative impact on trade, investment, and the loss of access to the EU single market. The financial sector, in particular, has faced significant adjustments. Moreover, Brexit has raised questions about the future of the United Kingdom itself, with Scotland and Northern Ireland expressing desires to remain closer to the EU.

Brexit has also left its mark on the EU. The departure of one of its largest members has prompted soul-searching within the union. It has highlighted issues of Euroscepticism and the need to address citizens' concerns effectively. The EU has had to adjust its budget, recalibrate its policies, and redefine its relationships with the UK and other non-member countries. Additionally, Brexit has had political repercussions, potentially influencing the rise of nationalist and anti-EU sentiments in other member states.

Brexit has been a pivotal moment in European history, shaping the trajectory of the UK and the EU. The decision to leave the EU was driven by a complex mix of factors, including sovereignty concerns and economic disparities. The withdrawal process was protracted and challenging, with implications for both the UK and the EU. As the UK navigates its new relationship with the EU and redefines its role on the global stage, the full consequences of Brexit, both positive and negative, will continue to unfold in the years to come.
