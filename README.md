# Keyboard-AI

This code is based off of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOaPb9wrgDY

This code is a brute force method to try to find the best possible keyboard. This is not feasible as there are 30! permutations to the qwerty keyboard; however, I still decided to write this code for demo purposes. I will be writing my own genetic algorithm similar to the one used by Adumb in his video.
