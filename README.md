# Keyboard-AI

This code is based off of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOaPb9wrgDY

This code currently does not work as it calculates the distance taken to type a given amount of text incorrectly. If you can offer any help, I thank you greatly!

According to adumb, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." has a distance of 34.661, but my algorithm calculates it to 45.891.
